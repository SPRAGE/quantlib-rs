You are working on quantlib-rs, a Rust translation of the QuantLib C++ library.

Before doing ANY work, you MUST:

1. Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md` in the workspace root — it contains the complete
   project state, code conventions, translation workflows, and phase status.
2. Read `plan.md` §6.1 (progress snapshot) and §23 (next steps) for priorities.
3. Run `just check` to verify the workspace builds and tests pass.
4. Check the `## Work-in-Progress Log` section at the bottom of `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   to see if a previous session left unfinished work.

After completing any unit of work, you MUST update both `plan.md` and
`INSTRUCTIONS.md` to reflect the new state (see INSTRUCTIONS.md §10).

Never guess at project conventions — they are all documented in INSTRUCTIONS.md §4.
